The suggested name was `supreme-octo-couscous`; This is the example project that is referred to by https://interlok.adaptris.net/interlok-docs/advanced-profiler-logging-context.html

## Getting started

```
./gradlew clean check assemble
./run-adapter.sh (or roll your own)
curl -i -s http://localhost:8080/api/logging
```

What's interesting is the logging, not the HTTP response.
